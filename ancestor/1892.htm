Owen lived here until he died.  His will dated 3 Sept. 1805 was probated Jan. 1806.  He was a member of Coopers Run Baptist Church, Bourbon Co. KY.<br>_________________________<br>FAYETTE COUNTY, KENTUCKY<br><br>WILL BOOK "A" (1793 - 1809)<br>Page 291<br><br>Will of Owen Winn of Fayette County, gives to beloved wife Mary Winn the plantation he now lives on with all the farming utensils, all the household and kitchen furniture (except what he hereafter bequeaths), also five negroes Abram, Bob, Mill, Cumberland and Rachel, and a negro girl Darkey, during her natural life or widowhood. To daughter Sary Boggs, one negro woman named Harmar and her increase. To daughter Susannah Spurr, one negro girl named Lynn and her increase, also one feather bed and furniture, and one cow and calf. To daughter Elizabeth Vallandingham, one negro boy named Bill, one feather bed and furniture, and one cow and calf. And whereas he gave to his daughter Polly King a negro girl named Ferry and the amount of a featherbed and cow and calf, but inasmuch as his beloved daughter Polly and the girl he gave her have both departed this life, and the daughter leaving two children Jane King and John King, and for the testator’s love and affection for them, it is his desire that at the death of the testator’s wife, they shall have a horse each although their mother had already received her equal dividend. To daughter Jane Grimes, one negro boy named john, also one feather bed and furniture, and one cow and calf. To daughter Anna Gess, one negro boy named James, one featherbed and furniture, and one cow and calf. To daughter Lydia Spurr, one negro boy named Harry, one featherbed and furniture, and one cow and calf. And it is to be understood that the legacies given herewith to his children Sary, Susannah, Elizabeth, Polly, Jane, Anny and Lydia, have been fully received by them. To son John Winn, the tract of land on the Cross Plains containing 70 acres, purchased of Robert Frank, Jr., also two negroes Sharlet and Hager, one featherbed and furniture, and one cow and calf. To daughter Doshia Young, two negro girls named Jude and Hannah, and their increase, one horse bridle and saddle, one featherbed and furniture, and one cow and calf. To son Nathaniel Winn, one-half of the plantation the testator now lives on, at the death of his mother, also two negroes Rose and Ben and their increase, one horse bridle and saddle, one bed and furniture, one cow and calf. To daughter Barbary Winn, the remaining half of the plantation at the death of her mother, also three negroes Maria, Viny and Clary and their increase, one horse bridle and saddle, one featherbed and furniture, and one cow and calf. And whereas it is presumable that the testator’s wife has an interest in some negroes now in the possession of her father, John Cotton of Nelson County, to which interest the testator conceives himself interested, he bequeaths such claim to his sons John and Nathaniel. At the death of the wife, the whole of the estate in her hands to be equally divided among all the children. Appoints wife Mary, and son John as executors. September 8, 1805.
