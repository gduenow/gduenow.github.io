Minor married Martha Ann Byrd (b. 1663, d. 1748) on May 12, 1698 in VA.  Martha was the daughter of William Byrd (b. 1652, d. 1704), frontiersman, and Maria Taylor. Martha was born in Middlesex, VA.  Martha's family owned the Eden Plantation in Charles City, Prince William County, VA.  Minor and Ann inherited the plantation in 1710.  Minor died in Eden Plantation, Prince William County, VA in 1730.  Martha died in Eden Plantation, Prince William County, VA.<br>Martha's father was William Byrd II, son of William Byrd Sr. and Mary "Maria" Horsmonden.  William II was born on March 28, 1674 in Henrico County, VA.  We are unsure when he married Maria Taylor.  However, we know that she died sometime before 1705 because he remarried on May 4, 1706 to Lucy Parke.  He died on August 26, 1744 in England, VA.  He was buried at Westover Gardens in Charles City County, VA.  Martha's mother was Maria Taylor.  She was born in 1643 in Charles City, Westover, VA. William Byrd Sr. was born in 1652 in London, England.  He married Mary "Maria" Horsmonden.  William Sr. died on December 4, 1704 and was buried at Westover Church, Charles City, VA.  Mary "Maria" Horsmonden was born in 1652 in Ham, Lenham Parish, Kent England.  William Sr. was her second husband.  Her first husband was Samuel Filmer, who she married in 1667. Mary died on November 9, 1699 and was buried at Westover Church, Charles City County, VA.  (Sources: (1) Genealogy of the Winn Fam!<br> ily 1500<br> to 1939 by James A.
