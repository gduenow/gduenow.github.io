In<br>1794 he began to be taxed on 100 acres of land on Otter Creek (also listed<br>as Tates Creek or Tates and Otter Creek).  He was taxed for this land until<br>1823.  In 1826, James Turner and Jemima, his wife, sold 100 acres on Tates<br>Creek to Robert Goggins (Madison Co., Kentucky Deed Book R page 185).
