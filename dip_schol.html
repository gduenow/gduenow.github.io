<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3><B>The National Diplomacy
Scholarship</B></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>A case for a National
Diplomacy Scholarship</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">by <A HREF="mailto:gbduenow@gmx.net">Greg
Duenow</A></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>I belong to a fraternal
(college) organization. Our local chapter has setup an annual
scholarship foundation. Our size is approximately the same as the
Diplomacy hobby, if not smaller, (we have 102 members in our Yahoo
group). Since inception of the Scholarship in 2000 we have received
$15,000 in donations and corporate matching funds.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>Heath Gardner (outgoing
Dip Pouch editor) and I were at DixieCon discussing ways to increase
the Diplomacy hobby ranks among high school and college students. I
mentioned the success of my fraternity's scholarship. We then bounced
the idea around of a National Diplomacy Scholarship. He suggested I
write an article for the Pouch to guage interest.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At first I thought that a Diplomacy
Scholarship would be kind of silly. It is a board game after all.
Scholarships are given to bright students or outstanding athletes,
not conniving back-stabbers. But then I remembered reading an article
about a scholarship for <A HREF="http://www.finaid.org/scholarships/unusual.phtml">Duck
Calling</A>, (you know, like Elmer Fudd). Who would give away money
to people based on their ability to deceive birds?  That thought
pushed me over the edge to write this proposal. This game teaches
more to it's students than duck calling. So I collected my thoughts,
reviewed scholarship documentation and conferred with my fraternity
brothers, setting in stone this flawless manifesto.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>The following five
categories are broken up into pertinent discussions we would need to
have to get the scholarship setup. There are many things in a
scholarship foundation's By-Laws that I am not touching because it's
mainly legal jargon. All that can be fleshed out later.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3><B>1.</B> Criteria</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>The toughest question for
a National Diplomacy Scholarship is what criteria determine the
scholarship recipient. Our hobby is vast yet varied. It spans gamers
sitting in high school cafeterias, old geezers sending snail mail,
busy professionals writing vindictive emails and globe trotting face
to face stalwarts.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>How do we include the most
groups to garner the most interest in Diplomacy? Should there be
separate awards for PBEM, FTF and snail mail? Should the system
incorporate all three into some kind of bizarre trigonometric
equation?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>First we must look at our
own introduction to the hobby. The vast majority of us were hooked
via face to face games. A buddy bought the game, got seven people
together and you dived right in. You probably played voraciously for
a couple of months before girls, cars and summertime broke up the
group. Afterwards you tried to get a game together, sometimes
successfully. Later you discovered postal or email play, it being
much easier to get a game going that away.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>What binds us to Diplomacy
is our youthful Face to Face beginnings. The scholarship's goal is to
seek out more of these events. Therefore we must make the scholarship
a catalyst for Face to Face games amongst youths.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>A Criteria system should
focus on the following three items:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>1. It should be a system
that rewards Diplomacy players who play and promote the game.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>2. It should have clear,
simple rules.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>3. It should have checks
to ensure fairness.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>That being said, I've come
up with three potential criteria for awarding the scholarship, with
Pros and Cons:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>a.</B> Highest <A HREF="http://www.diplom.org/NADF">Grand

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3><B>2. </B>Eligibility</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>Who is eligible to apply
for our scholarship?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>Here we must look at our
potential audiences and determine from which will most readily form
the vast army of future diplomats. Will college students who have a
lot of free time and free reign over their domain be our best bet?
Will they look at a scholarship for a board game as an awesome ironic
feather in the cap? Or will they shy away from the stigma of the 2
liter Mt. Dew drinking gamer?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>Or perhaps high school
students would be a better audience. Their pliable minds ready for
indoctrination into the deceptive and intriguing nuances of
Diplomacy. Potential paranoid parents may prove to be road blocks, so
we will have to name drop, &ldquo;Kennedy, Cronkite, Kissinger&rdquo;.
Thereby validating the credibility of this most noblest of games.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>To answer the eligibility
question we must again look to the past. Where did we first get
hooked? Personally for me it was in college. But I know many others
who got the bug in high school. Our goal is to increase exposure. I
propose the scholarship be for anyone under the age of 20. Young
minds still discovering their interests. Pursuing their ideology.
Diplomacy has the potential to make one better at debate, discourse
and decisions. &ldquo;Whil that iren is hoot, men sholden smyte&rdquo;.
Keen to learn, eager for guidance, young people will be best served
by the skills learned in Diplomacy. And once they get the fire in
their belly, they will spread their desire.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>Eligibility guidelines:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3><B>a. </B>Awardee shall be
attending a high school or college, and have a G.P.A. Of at least
2.0.</FONT></P>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3><B>3. </B>Ruling Body /
By-Laws</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>The Ruling Body,
(hereafter referred to as the Board), should include people that have
a vested interest in seeing the number of Diplomacy players increase.
Unlike a fraternal organization, the Diplomacy hobby is very fluid.
Having a static group of people as our voting members would be
short-sighted. Many of our members come and go. Some Diplomacy
players are very consistent in the hobby for decades. Some play
sporadically for years. Others come to the game only for a short
period of time. Our pool of members needs to reflect that. The
By-Laws should also allow for the change of the voting pool in case
of an unforseen change in the way our hobby works.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>The actual By-Laws will be
much more extensive. Here I am touching on some points that I feel
are pertinent to this article.</FONT></P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>The Board shall be
	composed of four people. Only three shall have voting power -
	President, Secretary and Treasurer. First, an odd number ensures
	voting feasibility. Second, three is small enough to make decisions
	without hindrance, yet is accountable to more than one person. There
	will also be one non voting member, Vice President.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>Board term length = 3
	years</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>The Chair, President
	and Treasurer must be voted into office.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>The Vice President
	will be appointed by the three voting members.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>In case of emergency
	/ abandonment by a Board member, the Vice President shall assume
	that person's role until a replacement is found.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>Board / voting pool =
	<I>My initial thought would be the following:</I> Participants in
	latest Dipcon, plus 4 - 10 permanent members, (Alan Calhammer, Edi
	Birsan, Buzz Eddy, Dave Maletsky, David Hood, previous scholarship
	winners, a Hasbro representative, current Dip Pouch editor,
	Diplom.org head, tournament directors of Grand Prix Diplomacy
	events, etc...). <I>This list is obviously subjective, as I play FTF
	and on the DPJudge mainly.</I></FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>The Board should meet
	once a year. This would be to determine winner, award size, and if
	any Board member wants/needs to be replaced. Meetings should be in
	person, but if all else fails, IM, EMail or phone meetings can
	suffice.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>The Board can vote to
	change voting pool. This must be approved by current voting pool.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>Quorum for all non

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3><B>4. </B>Prize</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>The prize for our
scholarship will of course depend on the amount of funds available.
I'm sure the first couple of years will be rather meager. But with
the generous donations from our great populace of Lawyers, Self-Made
Men, IT professionals, Financial Wizards, Accountants, and other
wealthy donors, our Scholarship fund will increase to a great amount
quickly. Initially the prize would be monetary only, but eventually
could include travel / lodging to Diplomacy Events. If enough money
is gathered, we could break the award into multiple regional
scholarships and a national scholarship.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>Prize guidelines:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3><B>a. </B>Award(s) granted
in one year shall not exceed 20% of all funds.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3><B>b. </B>Relatives of
Board members are not eligible for any awards.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>c. </B>Award shall be either used
for travel / lodging to Diplomacy events as designated by the board,
or for education expenses.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3><B>5. </B>Miscellaneous</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>As many good hearted
people have found, giving can be a pain. The fraternal scholarship in
which I participate has 2 main issues:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3><B>a. </B>Getting
Applications</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>Whether we receive few or
incomplete applications, it is always a challenge to foster interest
in scholarships. Not all young people are interested in applying. And
ours will be difficult as the whole premise would be to gather
interest in our hobby. I would therefore emphasize making the award
overly simplistic. Maybe even automatic, (highest Grand Prix rating
is a no-brainer here). Whatever the mechanism, we need to ensure the
whole transaction is a positive experience for the award winner,
(avoid 'Haughty Donor Syndrome').</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3><B>b. </B>Legal issues /
tax compliance</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>The rules for scholarships
change, and while not overly complex, do require some time and effort
to maintain. If/when the dollar amount reaches the $20,000 range, a
third party scholarship managing organization should be looked at by
the Board. The reason being is that Board members may become
overwhelmed by their responsibilities in the accounting department.
This should require a vote by the entire voting population, not just
the Board.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3><I>Conclusion:</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>The
potential rewards of a National Diplomacy Scholarship are an increase
in the pool of Diplomacy players, and a greater sense of community
among the Diplomacy Corps, (PBEM, FTF and Snail Mail). The obstacles
to overcome in setting up the scholarship are challenging, but
Dipsters enjoy wrapping their minds around problems. This one should
be a walk in the park.</FONT></P>
