Campaign takes place on the continent called Zryous.

Vaboedewii rules over Chasmgorve, (for the last 30 years).
Recently his forces have taken Kulzh.

the humans of chasmgorve are Mediteranean looking.

to the southeast are western european looking folk.  their society is 
not very advanced, mainly due to the foul weather.  some of the area is 
under attack by Vabeodewi's forces.

The most advanced society is the Ship-Building/Wizards of D'tra that 
live on a large island to the west of Zryous.  these 
people resemble africans of earth.

Not far behind is the kingdom of Nafir.  Asians.  They grow tobacco, 
cocoa, coca.  They also make beer and wine.

There is a rogue island of pirates.  Their city is very large, and 
slavery is prevalent.

Lastly, on a remote peninsula is an albino/nordic people.  Not much is 
known about them.  (Barbarians).



Elves are common in Nafir and uncommon elsewhere.

Dwarves are populus on the large peninsula in the upper
left hand corner of the map, and common elsewhere.  They serve
as smiths and builders in human cities.

Orcs are common on the campaign continent, but not found 
anywhere else.
