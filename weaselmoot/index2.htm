<title>HTML Redirection Example</title>
<META HTTP-EQUIV="Refresh"
      CONTENT="5; URL=html-redirect2.html">
</head>
<body>
This page shows how to use an HTML &lt;META> tag in the header to redirect
to another page. The &lt;META> tag goes in the &lt;HEAD> section of your
HTML document. The &lt;META> tag on this page looks like:
<blockquote>
<pre>&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="Refresh"
      CONTENT="5; URL=html-redirect2.html"></pre>
</blockquote>
The "5" means to wait 5 seconds before redirecting. The
"html-redirect2.html" after "url=" is the URL of the page to which to
redirect.
<p>
These two pages, "html-redirect.html" and "html-redirect2.html", will
continue to switch back and forth until you close the window.
<p>
It is customary to include a direct link to the page that will be
switched to automatically in case you get an older browser that
doesn't support the feature or the user doesn't want to
wait. Something like:
<blockquote>
This page has moved. If your browser doesn't automatically redirect to
its new location, click
<a href="html-redirect2.html">
here</a>.
</blockquote>
</body>
</html>
